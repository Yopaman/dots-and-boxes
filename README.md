# Dots and Boxes

"Dot and Boxes" or "Pipopipette" in french is a two players game you can play with paper and pencil. I decided to recreate it using pure Typescript. Currently, you can only play offline, on the same computer. The main goal of this project is for me to practice Typescript, and have fun.
